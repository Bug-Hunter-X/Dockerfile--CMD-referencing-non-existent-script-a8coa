This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the CMD instruction attempts to run a script that is not present in the image. The original Dockerfile fails because the `/app` directory and the `my_script.py` file are not created or copied into the image. The solution Dockerfile addresses this by creating the directory, copying the script, and ensuring all dependencies are installed correctly.  This example uses a simple Python script, but the issue can occur with any language or application.
